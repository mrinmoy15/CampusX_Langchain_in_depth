# LANGCHAIN AND LANGGRAPH 
In this module we will learn in depth about both Langchain framework and how those frameworks are revolutionizing the development of LLM powered agentic applications. This course is taught by Nitesh and the link to the courses are provided below.

## Langchain Componets:
These are the most important components of Langchain framework:
- Models: Language Models and Embedding Models
- Prompts: Prompt Templates
- Chains: LLM Pipeline
- Memory: Conversation Memory
- Indexes: a structured way of organizing and storing external documents
- Agents: AI agents 
  
In this course we will learn in detail about these components. This code repo will contain examples for each component that can be leveraged later in Big Projects.
  
  
## Langchain Utilities:
There are many utilities that streamline RAG developments are also offered. For example:
- document loaders: text loaders, pdf loaders, web base loaders, directory loaders, csv loaders etc. We can also make our custom loaders. No need to remeber all, we will check it in documentation based on our requirements for a project.
- text splitters: length based, text structure based, document structure based, sementic meaning based
- vectore stores: FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, Mil
- retriever: categories based on data source, e.g. wilkipedia, vector store, arxiv  
             categories based on search strategy, e.g. MMR, MultiQuery, Contextual Compression

We will have examples in this codebase of some of the above utilities.
